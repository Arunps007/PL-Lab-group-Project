JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: \\u201cThe tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government\\u2019s ambitious Make in India programme.\\u201d   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added. Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: \\u201cSlowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today\\u2019s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.\\u201d   On the flip side, this decision would see the government\\u2019s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. \\u201cHowever, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,\\u201d Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a \\u201cmilestone effort\\u201d to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. \\u201cThis substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,\\u201d he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. \\u201cAs a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,\\u201d Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector. Ekta World Chairman Ashok Mohanani said the decision has brought in a ray of light for the economy and hoped that sentiments would change in the real estate sector as well. Prashant Solomon, MD, Chintels India said: \\u201cFor the Real estate sector this is an added benefit as it will encourage new entrants across the 200 ancillary industries that are essential to the sector\\u2019s growth.\\u201d   The revenue foregone by the government on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures will now help companies focus on investing in areas which can fillip growth in their respective sectors, said Honeyy Katiyal, Founder of Investors Clinic.

Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: \\u201cSlowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today\\u2019s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.\\u201d   On the flip side, this decision would see the government\\u2019s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. \\u201cHowever, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,\\u201d Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a \\u201cmilestone effort\\u201d to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. \\u201cThis substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,\\u201d he added.

Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector. Ekta World Chairman Ashok Mohanani said the decision has brought in a ray of light for the economy and hoped that sentiments would change in the real estate sector as well.
