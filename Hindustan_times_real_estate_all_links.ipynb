      "Housing society can’t be forced to participate in cluster development: Bombay HC\n",
      "The Bombay high court on Friday said a co-operative housing society cannot be forced to participate in any development project without its lawful consent, based on a resolution of its properly constituted general body meeting.\n",
      "The division bench of justice SC Dharmadhikari and justice Gautam Patel said it was wholly impermissible to include property of such a society in any form of development, redevelopment or cluster development project without notice, without opportunity of hearing or without specific consent of the society, based on lawful resolution appropriately carried at its properly convened general body meeting.\n",
      "The bench was hearing a petition filed by Jawahar Jyoti co-operative housing society at Panchpakhadi in Thane challenging resolution passed Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) in its general body meeting on December 10, 2018.\n",
      "The resolution included property of the petitioner society in a cluster development project, although its name did not find a place in any of the 44 urban renewal projects published by the civic body till then.\n",
      "The society contended that its name was included in a cluster development project only on suggestion of two adjoining housing societies, Rajtara co-operative housing society and Garodia co-operative housing society, both of which have been included in the cluster development project.\n",
      "The petitioner society’s lawyer, advocate Neeta Karnik, pointed out that its forcible inclusion in the cluster development project would impose unwarranted restrictions on its ownership right over its own property and therefore the resolution was liable to be struck down.\n",
      "In its reply to the petition, TMC conceded the name of Jawahar Jyoti co-operative housing society was included in the cluster development scheme on a suggestion given by the neighbouring societies, and stated the petitioner society was free to develop its property on its own, if it did not want to participate in the cluster development project and take its benefit.\n",
      "The bench accepted the statement but clarified that no one can dictate to the petitioner society how their property should be developed or redeveloped or in what proposal or project it should be included, save and except by its lawful consent.\n",
      "It also clarified that the statement of the civic body meant that the petitioner society will not be included in the cluster development project and any application for development permissions by it will be considered on its own merit.\n",

      "UP real estate authority goes online, e-courts to start from November\n",
      "The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority( UP-Rera) is all set to start e-courts from November. Under the authority’s plan, a complainant will have come only once to the court at the time of final arguments before UP-Rera benches deliver the order. The move is expected to save time and facilitate speedy disposal of cases.\n",
      "UP-Rera chairman Rajive Kumar said, “As of now, though we receive applications online, and during the hearings, complainants have to come several times to the UP-Rera to plead their case. Our plan is to introduce e-courts from November. Under this process, a complainant will have to come only at the final hearing stage.”\n",
      "Explaining how the workings of the planned e-court system, Kumar said, “On receiving an online complaint, a builder will be asked to submit a reply and the reply will then be emailed to the complainant. After this, the complainant will file a counter reply or can come up with more pleadings. These replies or further pleadings will be emailed to the builder’s representative. On getting a response from the builder to the complainant’s queries, the complainant will be asked to file counter reply. Both builder and complainant will be asked to submit the evidence and supporting documents.”\n",
      "“Once all documents and replies and counter replies are presented, the complainant and the builder representative will be called at UP-Rera court for a final hearing. Both parties will argue their cases, and the UP-Rera bench can then either issue an order the same day or reserve the order and then issue the order within next few days, and both parties will get a copy of the order. However, for getting a certified copy of the order, one will have to apply online and pay the prescribed fee,” Kumar added.\n",
      "Officials said once the e-court system is introduced, all the new complaints will be processed under this system. “The system is expected to be very effective and time-saving and will help in speedy disposal of cases. The existing complaints will, however, be dealt with as per the present system,” Kumar said.\n",
      "The move has been welcomed by some complainants as well. “Presently, in the first two or three hearings, the complainant and the builder only exchange replies. They also seek time to file replies to each other’s submissions. With the introduction of e-courts, these visits will not be needed and it will save our time and expenses spent on travelling too,” Anil Kumar, a complainant who had come to attend the hearing in his case before Bench 1 of the UP-Rera on Thursday.\n",
      "Advocates too feel the e-court system will help in speedy disposal of cases.  “Right now we need to visit the court at least three to four times before a judgement is reserved. Each date falls in a gap of roughly one month.

      "UP real estate authority goes online, e-courts to start from November\n",
      "The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority( UP-Rera) is all set to start e-courts from November. Under the authority’s plan, a complainant will have come only once to the court at the time of final arguments before UP-Rera benches deliver the order. The move is expected to save time and facilitate speedy disposal of cases.\n",
      "UP-Rera chairman Rajive Kumar said, “As of now, though we receive applications online, and during the hearings, complainants have to come several times to the UP-Rera to plead their case. Our plan is to introduce e-courts from November. Under this process, a complainant will have to come only at the final hearing stage.”\n",
      "Explaining how the workings of the planned e-court system, Kumar said, “On receiving an online complaint, a builder will be asked to submit a reply and the reply will then be emailed to the complainant. After this, the complainant will file a counter reply or can come up with more pleadings. These replies or further pleadings will be emailed to the builder’s representative. On getting a response from the builder to the complainant’s queries, the complainant will be asked to file counter reply. Both builder and complainant will be asked to submit the evidence and supporting documents.”\n",
      "“Once all documents and replies and counter replies are presented, the complainant and the builder representative will be called at UP-Rera court for a final hearing. Both parties will argue their cases, and the UP-Rera bench can then either issue an order the same day or reserve the order and then issue the order within next few days, and both parties will get a copy of the order. However, for getting a certified copy of the order, one will have to apply online and pay the prescribed fee,” Kumar added.\n",
      "Officials said once the e-court system is introduced, all the new complaints will be processed under this system. “The system is expected to be very effective and time-saving and will help in speedy disposal of cases. The existing complaints will, however, be dealt with as per the present system,” Kumar said.\n",
      "The move has been welcomed by some complainants as well. “Presently, in the first two or three hearings, the complainant and the builder only exchange replies. They also seek time to file replies to each other’s submissions. With the introduction of e-courts, these visits will not be needed and it will save our time and expenses spent on travelling too,” Anil Kumar, a complainant who had come to attend the hearing in his case before Bench 1 of the UP-Rera on Thursday.\n",

      "Housing sales dips 18 per cent in July-September quarter across top 7 cities: Report\n",
      "Housing sales declined 18 per cent to 55,080 units during the July-September period across seven major cities as buyers were cautious in making property investments, according to real estate services firm Anarock.\n",
      "Housing sales stood at 67,140 units in the year-ago period across seven cities --- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai metropolitan region, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad.\n",
      "“Around 55,080 units were sold in Q3 2019 – a decline of 20 per cent over Q2 2019, and a 18 per cent year-on-year decline,” property consultant Anarock said in a report.\n",
      "Apart from low sentiments, Anarock attributed the fall in housing sales to ban on subvention scheme and inauspicious ‘shraadh’ period.\n",

      "As Britain’s deadline to leave the European Union approaches, property prices have slowed or dropped, especially in London, with sector analysts warning of worse to come if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal.\n",
      "“The market is at a standstill,” said Beatrice Caboche, director at real estate company Barnes UK.\n",
      "Average property sales prices rose just 0.7 percent in July, their slowest increase in nearly seven years.\n",
      "Analysts blame a process set in motion with a 2016 Brexit referendum.\n",
      "“Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.\n",
      "Many investors expect the market to weaken further and don’t want to overpay for property that will be worth less if, for example, Britain leaves the EU without a negotiated deal.\n",
      "Potential sellers, on the other hand, often prefer to leave their houses empty rather than accept a price they deem too low -- a stance that seems to add to an already acute housing crisis.\n",
      "Decade-low\n",
      "In London, property values dropped by four percent in the first quarter from their year-earlier level, the sharpest drop since 2009 when the global financial crisis was raging.\n",
      "In wealthy London neighbourhoods, like Mayfair, Knightsbridge or South Kensington, the price falls have been most spectacular as they plunged from the dizzying heights of recent years.\n",
      "“Transactions of high-end homes in central London last year reached a decade low,” according to data group LonRes, which said that the market had already been under pressure from stamp duty changes.\n",
      "A property put on the market for 14 million pounds ($17.2 million, 15.7 million euros) four years ago could be sold now for nine million, said Caboche.\n",
      "She said it’s not just the market’s high end that is suffering but the Brexit impact is being felt among cheaper housing, too, and across the entire country, with perhaps more of a lasting impact than even the financial crisis.\n",
      "“This time around, prices have been falling more slowly, but continuously, and we don’t see any coming recovery,” she said.\n",
      "Buyer’s market\n",
      "Meanwhile, the sales commissions collected by estate agents have been dropping as transaction numbers fall, causing a bad mood in the profession.\n",
      "But there’s a flipside to the suffering of sellers and middlemen: Some buyers are finding that the property market, which had priced them out a long time ago, has again become accessible.\n",
      "Moreover, historically-low interest rates are an enticing proposition for anyone shopping for a mortgage.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the decline of the pound, which is trading around 20 percent lower against the dollar than before the Brexit referendum, has vastly improved the purchasing power of non-residents eyeing British property.   \n",
      "“It’s a buyer’s market,” said Caboche.\n",
      "Some call the slowdown a necessary correction after years of double-digit price growth, particularly in London which is one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n",
      "Either way, “house price growth has reached its nadir,” said analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding they now expected a recovery in 2020 as “the housing market appears to be emerging gradually from the coma induced by Brexit uncertainty”.\n",
      "The market could grow by more than one percent next year, they said, but only if a no-deal Brexit is averted.\n",

      "What NRIs should watch out for when investing in Indian real estate\n",
      "When it comes to inward remittance, India tops the global list. According to a World Bank report, Migration and Development Brief, released in April this year, the top remittance recipients include India with $79 billion, followed by China ($67 billion) and Mexico ($36 billion). In fact, it has been on the rise in India, according to data in successive WB reports.\n",
      "Typically, half of the remittances received by Indian residents are used for maintenance of families, followed by deposits in banks, but a major chunk is also invested in real estate, according to information on Reserve Bank of India (RBI) website. “NRI investments in Indian real estate has doubled from $5 billion in 2014 to $10.2 billion in 2018,” according to a report released in 2018 by 360 Realtors, a consultant firm, on the state of NRI investments in Indian real estate. In fact, nearly 63% NRIs prefer real estate over any other investment in India, shows data from ANAROCK’s consumer sentiment survey for H1 2019.\n",
      "Though real estate remains a favourite with NRIs, Mint does not recommend investments in this asset class because of concerns such as high transaction cost, illiquidity, delayed construction and the chances of default by the developer. “NRIs should not invest in real estate because of low returns and high risk, unless there is a specific need or they have plans to return to India,” said Rohit Shah, founder and CEO, GettingYouRich, a financial planning firm.\n",
      "However, given that a lot of NRIs may still go ahead and invest in Indian real estate, especially with the recent rupee depreciation, we list out the segments they should consider and the concerns they should keep an eye on.\n",
      "Where to invest?\n",
      "To decide where they can invest in India, NRIs first need to address this question: whether they are buying the property for end use or for investment.\n",
      "For end use, there are plenty of options, given the slowdown in the sector. “The residential market, specifically, is better placed this year as speculation-led investment activity has reduced significantly. Residential prices have remained stable in most cities over the past few years. Increased transparency in the market and eased investment norms has made the market more attractive for NRIs. Developers too are offering customized solutions for this segment by developing ‘smart’ homes with international appeal,” said Abhinav Joshi, head of research, CBRE India, a real estate consultant.\n",
      "For investment, the commercial real estate segment may be a better option. “While residential real estate continues to be the ‘first love’ of NRIs, India’s commercial office property asset class presents a profitable alternative for NRI investors. Good capital appreciation and rental yield has increased NRI demand for Grade A offices, IT parks, logistics centres, and now REITs (real estate investment trusts) as well,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants. A good commercial property can give an average rental yield of 6-10% against the current residential property rental yield of 1.5-3.5%, he added.\n",
      "“Rental yields from residential real estate can be around 2%, and professionally managed commercial property can fetch better returns. But in any case, post tax return can’t be more 7-8% from real estate, so we typically do not recommend,” said Shah.\n",
      "Rules to watch out for\n",
      "An NRI can buy any kind of property, except agricultural land. Also, the investment must not violate the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Reserve Bank of India regulations.\n",
      "Payment rules: The payment can be made from funds received in India through normal banking channels or funds held in non-resident ordinary (NRO), non-resident external (NRE) or foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) accounts maintained in India. “NRIs can transfer the money to his or her NRO account in India and pay the seller from there or can also directly transfer the amount to the account of seller in India,” said Amit Maheshwari, partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a law firm.\n",
      "Repatriation rules: According to rules under FEMA, repatriation of proceeds from the sale of a property cannot exceed $1 million in a financial year. However, if the property is inherited or gifted to the NRI, they may repatriate more than $1 million per financial year.\n",
      "Taxation and other rules: NRIs need to watch out for certain rules when buying, selling or renting out a property. While buying the property, “NRIs need to withhold TDS (tax deducted at source) from the price payable to the seller,” said Maheshwari. NRIs need to deduct TDS at the rate of 1% of the property value, if the property’s value is above Rs 50 lakh.\n",
      "“On the sale of the asset, the buyer will deduct TDS from the amount payable to the NRI and the NRI can transfer the amount outside India or to his or her NRE account after paying due taxes,” said Maheshwari. TDS rate in this case is 30% (short-term) or 20% (long-term) of the property value.\n",
      "In case of rental income or capital gains, NRIs are taxed the way resident Indians are. They can even claim deductions available to a resident individual. “An NRI, being an individual gets taxed at the same rate of tax as applicable to an Indian individual. The highest rate of tax shall be 30% and surcharge shall be applicable based on the total income,” said Hemal Mehta, partner, Deloitte India, a tax and audit firm.\n",
      "Similarly, “capital gains arising from the sale of immovable property shall be taxable at the rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge (it is charged over and above the tax amount, in case the total income exceeds a certain limit) if the same is long-term capital gains, else the rate is 30% plus applicable surcharge,” added Mehta. Investment in real estate is considered long term if it is held for more than two years.\n",
      "It is as important, or perhaps more, important for NRIs to do their due diligence before investing in real estate as it is for resident Indians. It makes sense to check the property title and the financial health of the builder, especially if you are opting for an under-construction project. Also, keep in mind that real estate is a highly illiquid asset.\n",

      "For end use, there are plenty of options, given the slowdown in the sector. “The residential market, specifically, is better placed this year as speculation-led investment activity has reduced significantly. Residential prices have remained stable in most cities over the past few years. Increased transparency in the market and eased investment norms has made the market more attractive for NRIs. Developers too are offering customized solutions for this segment by developing ‘smart’ homes with international appeal,” said Abhinav Joshi, head of research, CBRE India, a real estate consultant.\n",
      "For investment, the commercial real estate segment may be a better option. “While residential real estate continues to be the ‘first love’ of NRIs, India’s commercial office property asset class presents a profitable alternative for NRI investors. Good capital appreciation and rental yield has increased NRI demand for Grade A offices, IT parks, logistics centres, and now REITs (real estate investment trusts) as well,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants. A good commercial property can give an average rental yield of 6-10% against the current residential property rental yield of 1.5-3.5%, he added.\n",
      "“Rental yields from residential real estate can be around 2%, and professionally managed commercial property can fetch better returns. But in any case, post tax return can’t be more 7-8% from real estate, so we typically do not recommend,” said Shah.\n",
      "Rules to watch out for\n",
      "An NRI can buy any kind of property, except agricultural land. Also, the investment must not violate the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Reserve Bank of India regulations.\n",
      "Payment rules: The payment can be made from funds received in India through normal banking channels or funds held in non-resident ordinary (NRO), non-resident external (NRE) or foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) accounts maintained in India. “NRIs can transfer the money to his or her NRO account in India and pay the seller from there or can also directly transfer the amount to the account of seller in India,” said Amit Maheshwari, partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a law firm.\n",
      "Repatriation rules: According to rules under FEMA, repatriation of proceeds from the sale of a property cannot exceed $1 million in a financial year. However, if the property is inherited or gifted to the NRI, they may repatriate more than $1 million per financial year.\n",
      "Taxation and other rules: NRIs need to watch out for certain rules when buying, selling or renting out a property. While buying the property, “NRIs need to withhold TDS (tax deducted at source) from the price payable to the seller,” said Maheshwari. NRIs need to deduct TDS at the rate of 1% of the property value, if the property’s value is above Rs 50 lakh.\n",
      "“On the sale of the asset, the buyer will deduct TDS from the amount payable to the NRI and the NRI can transfer the amount outside India or to his or her NRE account after paying due taxes,” said Maheshwari. TDS rate in this case is 30% (short-term) or 20% (long-term) of the property value.\n",
      "In case of rental income or capital gains, NRIs are taxed the way resident Indians are. They can even claim deductions available to a resident individual. “An NRI, being an individual gets taxed at the same rate of tax as applicable to an Indian individual. The highest rate of tax shall be 30% and surcharge shall be applicable based on the total income,” said Hemal Mehta, partner, Deloitte India, a tax and audit firm.\n",
      "Similarly, “capital gains arising from the sale of immovable property shall be taxable at the rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge (it is charged over and above the tax amount, in case the total income exceeds a certain limit) if the same is long-term capital gains, else the rate is 30% plus applicable surcharge,” added Mehta. Investment in real estate is considered long term if it is held for more than two years.\n",
      "It is as important, or perhaps more, important for NRIs to do their due diligence before investing in real estate as it is for resident Indians. It makes sense to check the property title and the financial health of the builder, especially if you are opting for an under-construction project. Also, keep in mind that real estate is a highly illiquid asset.\n",

      "Samajwadi Awas awaiting buyers, GDA  writes to state officials to decide cost of flats\n",
      "About 1,352 flats constructed under the Samajwadi Awas Yojna, a housing scheme launched under the previous Uttar Pradesh regime, are still waiting for buyers. The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) has raised this issue with the government to decide the fate of the flats so that they can be disposed of at the earliest. According to official estimates, the pending flats value about Rs 400 crore.\n",
      "Officials said the disposal of flats is on hold and cannot be put to auction during the regular auction of other unsold properties owned by the GDA. The GDA had constructed 2,563 such flats – 2,267 at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha housing schemes, and 296 at Madhuban Bapudham in 2015.\n",
      "“Each flat is a 2BHK and the average cost per flat is about Rs 30 lakh. Initially, all 2,267 flats at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha were booked but many buyers later opted for a refund. As of now, we have about 1,056 flats at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha and all 296 flats under this scheme at Madhuban Bapudhan left with us. Due to this, a lot of revenue inflow is stuck,” said an officer from authority’s property department.\n",
      "GDA sources said that the authority is stuck on two accounts – one, the same scheme with the name ‘Samajwadi’ may be difficult to launch under the present regime and two, a new scheme with a different name will involve escalation in prices.\n",
      "“Flats under the Samajwadi scheme were given to allottees after reduction of 3% each of contingency and overhead charges, which are loaded 15% each to the cost of the flats under normal schemes. The Samajwadi scheme has already closed down and the 3% exemption from the charges may not be available anymore. Further, if there is a new scheme launched for the flats, the cost will have to be revised as per current circle rates,” said Kanchan Verma, authority’s vice chairperson.\n",
      "Officials said they have requested the government to take a call on the matter. They added that the flats cannot be put to auction due to cost issues and this cannot be decided at the local level. Also, any new scheme for the flats will have to be decided by the state government.\n",

      "They say you’ve arrived once you own a home in Mumbai – the city of dreams is one of the world’s most expensive for real estate. There isn’t much room to grow, unless you’re growing vertically. And even then, some plots are more prized than others.\n",
      "So it’s no surprise that when property analyst firm Anarock, released their list of the country’s most expensive neighbourhoods from 2013 to the first half of 2019, Mumbai featured prominently. The surprise was that Tardeo was considered the most expensive place to buy a new home, with an average price tag of Rs 56,200 per sq ft\n",
      "Tardeo isn’t a better address than Worli, Prabhadevi or Lower Parel, it’s just that luxury homes are harder to find in that locality. Most new construction is on small plots occasionally made available by redevelopment. In seven years, only 1,100 premium units (with an average size of 1,690 sq ft) have been released for sale.\n",
      "“The other factor that often drives up prices is the saturation of luxury amenities in a project,” says Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock. “However, when it comes to the resale luxury market, areas like Nepean Sea Road, Altamount Road and Cuffe Parade are a lot costlier than Tardeo.”\n",
      "Pankaj Kapoor, managing director of the real-estate analytics firm Liases Foras, says that a neighbourhood plays a big role in determining the value of a home. “The expensive quotient comes from neighbourhood,” he says. “Demographic and geographical factors help make a locality expensive. But the product has to be high-end too.” \n",
      "TOP SPOTS\n",
      "Across the rest of the city, new expensive enclaves include Worli and Mahalaxmi, where 2- and 3-bedroom apartments dominate. At these hyper-expensive luxury residential locations, property commands Rs 41,500 and Rs 40,000 per sq ft respectively. \n",
      "These luxury properties offer an unrestricted view of the race course and sea views, premium amenities like self-sufficient high-grade educational and healthcare institutions as well as hotels and fine dining restaurants and privacy.\n",
      "In Tardeo, businessman and resident Sunil Sanghvi has seven flats in Sahakar Niwas. “We are a joint family and it made sense to get flats in the same building,” he says. They built on the home Sanghvi’s father bought in the building 35 years ago. “Five years back, we bought  a 1BHK for 48,000 per sq ft in the same building. One thing that I really like about Tardeo is the liveliness. There are huge shopping centres, markets and supermarkets, I see people everywhere at any point of time.”\n",
      "COUNTRY SWEEP\n",
      "Among the southern states, neighbourhoods in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore made it to the list. Nungambakkam, Egmore and Anna Nagar rank 4th, 5th and 7th respectively. But buyers in Chennai get possibly a better deal. The average built-up size of the premium units in Chennai is about 17% larger than those in MMR. In Chennai, luxury apartment sizes are in the range of 2,190-2,890 sq ft. These are prime areas where demand is high and supply is scarce.\n",
      "“Even the most expensive areas in Bangalore and Hyderabad come across as relatively affordable when compared to Mumbai,” says Puri. “Also, these cities still have sufficient land for development, so land scarcity has not yet kicked in. When it does, areas in these two cities are likely to join the ranks of India’s most expensive residential locations.”\n",

      "Shaped by the Metro: How connectivity boots real estate\n",
      "In India, the Metro rail or mass rapid transit (MRT) system is usually hailed in a clutch of hopeful terms: Dream project, high-speed corridor, success story of urban mobility, Make In India achievement. But often, we overlook how these transport systems come to shape how and where we live.\n",
      "New Metro links are changing the realty scene in Pune, Lucknow, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. As localities get better connected, cities are expanding their peripheries and developers have been cashing in on this infrastructure development.\n",
      "The Metro has helped a small city like Jaipur improve its connectivity and overall infrastructure, says Santhosh Kumar, vice chairman at Anarock Property Consultants. “The Metro started operations here in 2015, and since then it has reduced traffic woes and regularised public transportation,” he points out. “For city dwellers as well as thousands of tourists who visit the heritage city, commuting used to be chaotic and unorganised. Now the Metro link has played a role in appreciating real estate values of areas such as Civil Lines, Shyam Nagar, Ram Nagar and Mansarovar in Jaipur.”\n",
      "IMPACT ON TRACK\n",
      "Connectivity is the sole factor that determines the success of the sector, says Abhinav Joshi, head of research at CBRE, a realty research firm. “The entire affordable-housing concept of the government will be a failure without MRTS. It is dependent on connectivity,” he says.\n",
      "This is a strategic point for developers, he says. “Builders advertise their projects based on the proposed Metro link, adding premiums because a well-connected neighbourhood will get them more traction. The working population is especially attracted. This is done based on the market value 5 years down the line.”\n",
      "Rentals at IT parks connected by the Metro today have higher rates. At DLF Cyber City in Gurugram, rentals stood at Rs 60-67 per sq ft in 2012-2016. Now with the Metro connectivity and new phase launching, the rentals start from Rs 110 to Rs 130 sq  ft per month, he explains. “Similarly in Bengaluru, with the Whitefield phase Metro under construction, there are 1000s of housing projects being launched, including luxury homes,” he says.\n",
      "The Versova-Andheri stretch in Mumbai has seen 8%-10% appreciation in residential properties over a period of three years, says Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head – India at JLL, a real-estate advisory. “This happened mainly towards the east side, as traffic got eased on road and also access towards the commercial hub (Andheri East) became easy. The growth has been relatively good in this tight market. Andheri East is one of the locations that didn’t see slowdown in prices mainly because of Metro coming in and the infrastructure uplift.”\n",
      "Similarly in Bengaluru, the average monthly rentals for a standard 2BHK house spread over 1,000 sq ft is currently Rs 18,000 in Whitefield, rising by 31% since 2014 when monthly rentals were Rs 13,700, explains Kumar.\n",
      "Retailers also get a slice the perks. Following the Delhi model, Mumbai has witnessed tremendous development across the Metro routes. Malls are now being used by retailers – hypermarkets and food and beverage operators. Quite often these are now favourite meeting spots for college students and working professionals.\n",
      "Meanwhile in Delhi, traditional retail high-streets such as Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh have also seen improved footfall due to the presence of Metro connectivity, says Kumar.\n",
      "If we take a closer look at prominent cities such as London, New York and Singapore, their urban models have been developed around an integrated connectivity system with MRTS, says Rahul Grover, CEO of Sai Estate Consultants. “The concept is still very new in India and with it comes integrated townships, IT parks and the way people spend time in commuting changes.”\n",
      "LAST MILE HURDLES\n",
      "However, we lack the point-to-point connectivity, says Grover. “Metro has to connect the prominent landmarks and commercial hubs. If your workplace is not near a Metro station, you often end up taking another mode of transport and that gets pointless.”\n",
      "A trail of general issues follow during the construction phase of the Metro, say experts. There’s traffic congestion, followed by rise in pollution levels; challenges in land acquisition and hence, the execution takes many years.\n",
      "One interesting point is that, unlike residential projects that can hike their prices based on proposed Metro links, the office spaces reap the benefits only after the Metro line is functional, points out Joshi. With the current economic slowdown, Metros across cities could take more time for their completion and along with it, the projects near them could get delayed, speculates Grover.\n",

      "Residents go with the flow, use smart tech to save water\n",
      "Water conservation begins at home, in your apartment complex and colonies. You can start with something as simple as installing a low-flow water aerator on taps and showerheads, or recycle waste water to use for gardening, flushing and other quotidian household needs. \n",
      "As cities continue to urbanise, demand for fresh water is increasing, it’s hard to keep up supply. Civic bodies do not have adequate water infrastructure, climate change has led to erratic weather patterns. Combine that with mismanaged water resources, wasteful water policies and we have a looming water crisis. \n",
      "Waking up to this situation, many residential colonies and individual homes in India are using technology to save water. They are installing smart water meters to track water usage, installing waste-water treatment plants to recycle water in their societies and are even making drinking water out of thin air. \n",
      "Flowing uphill\n",
      "“There are only two ways to solve the water problem,” says Abilash Haridass, co-founder and chief of growth and strategy, WEGoT Utility Solutions. “Either you increase the supply of water or you decrease the demand.” One way to reduce demand is by using water sensors to keep track of water consumption in each household.\n",
      "In 2017, Bengaluru’s Pearl Tuscany complex, installed WEGoT’s VenAqua water sensor in its 48 apartments. The Chennai-based startup installed sensors in the water inlet of each apartment, helping homes to manage the entire water intake and use by analysing data to track flow, pressure and quality of water in real-time through an mobile phone application.\n",
      "“The platform can detect leakages and we can remotely shut taps and valves off from our mobile phones. It also tracks abnormal consumption like drips and fixture efficiency and helps buildings become more water efficient,” says Venkatesan Natesan, secretary of the society. He says that their monthly maintenance bill has been reduced by 70 percent. “In 2018 we paid around Rs 2,000 per month, now we barely pay Rs 800 and save 35 percent of water too.” The meter is given out free of cost and residents pay a monthly subscription fee of Rs. 140 for the service. \n",

      "Residents go with the flow, use smart tech to save water\n",
      "Water conservation begins at home, in your apartment complex and colonies. You can start with something as simple as installing a low-flow water aerator on taps and showerheads, or recycle waste water to use for gardening, flushing and other quotidian household needs. \n",
      "As cities continue to urbanise, demand for fresh water is increasing, it’s hard to keep up supply. Civic bodies do not have adequate water infrastructure, climate change has led to erratic weather patterns. Combine that with mismanaged water resources, wasteful water policies and we have a looming water crisis. \n",
      "Waking up to this situation, many residential colonies and individual homes in India are using technology to save water. They are installing smart water meters to track water usage, installing waste-water treatment plants to recycle water in their societies and are even making drinking water out of thin air. \n",
      "Flowing uphill\n",
      "“There are only two ways to solve the water problem,” says Abilash Haridass, co-founder and chief of growth and strategy, WEGoT Utility Solutions. “Either you increase the supply of water or you decrease the demand.” One way to reduce demand is by using water sensors to keep track of water consumption in each household.\n",
      "In 2017, Bengaluru’s Pearl Tuscany complex, installed WEGoT’s VenAqua water sensor in its 48 apartments. The Chennai-based startup installed sensors in the water inlet of each apartment, helping homes to manage the entire water intake and use by analysing data to track flow, pressure and quality of water in real-time through an mobile phone application.\n",
      "“The platform can detect leakages and we can remotely shut taps and valves off from our mobile phones. It also tracks abnormal consumption like drips and fixture efficiency and helps buildings become more water efficient,” says Venkatesan Natesan, secretary of the society. He says that their monthly maintenance bill has been reduced by 70 percent. “In 2018 we paid around Rs 2,000 per month, now we barely pay Rs 800 and save 35 percent of water too.” The meter is given out free of cost and residents pay a monthly subscription fee of Rs. 140 for the service. \n",

      "What NRIs should watch out for when investing in Indian real estate\n",
      "When it comes to inward remittance, India tops the global list. According to a World Bank report, Migration and Development Brief, released in April this year, the top remittance recipients include India with $79 billion, followed by China ($67 billion) and Mexico ($36 billion). In fact, it has been on the rise in India, according to data in successive WB reports.\n",
      "Typically, half of the remittances received by Indian residents are used for maintenance of families, followed by deposits in banks, but a major chunk is also invested in real estate, according to information on Reserve Bank of India (RBI) website. “NRI investments in Indian real estate has doubled from $5 billion in 2014 to $10.2 billion in 2018,” according to a report released in 2018 by 360 Realtors, a consultant firm, on the state of NRI investments in Indian real estate. In fact, nearly 63% NRIs prefer real estate over any other investment in India, shows data from ANAROCK’s consumer sentiment survey for H1 2019.\n",
      "Though real estate remains a favourite with NRIs, Mint does not recommend investments in this asset class because of concerns such as high transaction cost, illiquidity, delayed construction and the chances of default by the developer. “NRIs should not invest in real estate because of low returns and high risk, unless there is a specific need or they have plans to return to India,” said Rohit Shah, founder and CEO, GettingYouRich, a financial planning firm.\n",
      "However, given that a lot of NRIs may still go ahead and invest in Indian real estate, especially with the recent rupee depreciation, we list out the segments they should consider and the concerns they should keep an eye on.\n",
      "Where to invest?\n",
      "To decide where they can invest in India, NRIs first need to address this question: whether they are buying the property for end use or for investment.\n",
      "For end use, there are plenty of options, given the slowdown in the sector. “The residential market, specifically, is better placed this year as speculation-led investment activity has reduced significantly. Residential prices have remained stable in most cities over the past few years. Increased transparency in the market and eased investment norms has made the market more attractive for NRIs. Developers too are offering customized solutions for this segment by developing ‘smart’ homes with international appeal,” said Abhinav Joshi, head of research, CBRE India, a real estate consultant.\n",
      "For investment, the commercial real estate segment may be a better option. “While residential real estate continues to be the ‘first love’ of NRIs, India’s commercial office property asset class presents a profitable alternative for NRI investors. Good capital appreciation and rental yield has increased NRI demand for Grade A offices, IT parks, logistics centres, and now REITs (real estate investment trusts) as well,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants. A good commercial property can give an average rental yield of 6-10% against the current residential property rental yield of 1.5-3.5%, he added.\n",
      "“Rental yields from residential real estate can be around 2%, and professionally managed commercial property can fetch better returns. But in any case, post tax return can’t be more 7-8% from real estate, so we typically do not recommend,” said Shah.\n",
      "Rules to watch out for\n",
      "An NRI can buy any kind of property, except agricultural land. Also, the investment must not violate the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Reserve Bank of India regulations.\n",
      "Payment rules: The payment can be made from funds received in India through normal banking channels or funds held in non-resident ordinary (NRO), non-resident external (NRE) or foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) accounts maintained in India. “NRIs can transfer the money to his or her NRO account in India and pay the seller from there or can also directly transfer the amount to the account of seller in India,” said Amit Maheshwari, partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a law firm.\n",
      "Repatriation rules: According to rules under FEMA, repatriation of proceeds from the sale of a property cannot exceed $1 million in a financial year. However, if the property is inherited or gifted to the NRI, they may repatriate more than $1 million per financial year.\n",
      "Taxation and other rules: NRIs need to watch out for certain rules when buying, selling or renting out a property. While buying the property, “NRIs need to withhold TDS (tax deducted at source) from the price payable to the seller,” said Maheshwari. NRIs need to deduct TDS at the rate of 1% of the property value, if the property’s value is above Rs 50 lakh.\n",
      "“On the sale of the asset, the buyer will deduct TDS from the amount payable to the NRI and the NRI can transfer the amount outside India or to his or her NRE account after paying due taxes,” said Maheshwari. TDS rate in this case is 30% (short-term) or 20% (long-term) of the property value.\n",
      "In case of rental income or capital gains, NRIs are taxed the way resident Indians are. They can even claim deductions available to a resident individual. “An NRI, being an individual gets taxed at the same rate of tax as applicable to an Indian individual. The highest rate of tax shall be 30% and surcharge shall be applicable based on the total income,” said Hemal Mehta, partner, Deloitte India, a tax and audit firm.\n",
      "Similarly, “capital gains arising from the sale of immovable property shall be taxable at the rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge (it is charged over and above the tax amount, in case the total income exceeds a certain limit) if the same is long-term capital gains, else the rate is 30% plus applicable surcharge,” added Mehta. Investment in real estate is considered long term if it is held for more than two years.\n",
      "It is as important, or perhaps more, important for NRIs to do their due diligence before investing in real estate as it is for resident Indians. It makes sense to check the property title and the financial health of the builder, especially if you are opting for an under-construction project. Also, keep in mind that real estate is a highly illiquid asset.\n",

      "Real estate moving towards smaller homes across India: Report\n",
      "The liquidity crisis in the real estate industry, strict sanctioning of loans by banks and customers’ preference for affordable homes have resulted in developers offering smaller homes in major cities across India. A study released by realty consultant Anarock on Monday said that average apartment sizes have shrunk by 27% over the past five years — from 1,400 square feet in 2014 to nearly 1,020 sq ft in 2019 so far. \n",
      "However, what is surprising is that minimum decline (6%) in size of houses has been seen in the national capital region (NCR), which is one of the worst-hit realty markets in the country, the report said. \n",
      "According to the Anarock report, while average size of apartments offered for sale across the country came down to 1,020 sq ft, in the NCR the size was 1,390 sq ft. \n",
      "Experts said that the reason for reducing sizes of apartment was rising demand for affordable houses among buyers. Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, said that buyers increasingly wanted to take benefit of credit subsidy given to affordable housing, which is required to be priced less than Rs 45 lakh and the area should not exceed 60 square metre. “There is also GST benefit for affordable housing as it is fixed at 1% against 5% for mid-segment homes,” said Puri. \n",
      "Sanjay Sharma, a Gurugram-based realty consultant, said that the reason sizes have not come down in Delhi-NCR market is that a number of projects had already been launched in 1,500-1,800 sq ft for 2BHKs prior to 2014. “There is also a preference in Gurugram for larger apartments with more facilities and better common areas. Newer projects being launched now might be smaller as per the market demand,” Sharma said. \n",
      "The Anarock study says that the NCR saw least decline at 6%, while houses in Chennai went smaller by 8%, and in Bengaluru and Kolkata by 9%. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune saw highest reduction in size by 45% and 38%, respectively, the report said. \n",

      "Samajwadi Awas awaiting buyers, GDA  writes to state officials to decide cost of flats\n",
      "About 1,352 flats constructed under the Samajwadi Awas Yojna, a housing scheme launched under the previous Uttar Pradesh regime, are still waiting for buyers. The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) has raised this issue with the government to decide the fate of the flats so that they can be disposed of at the earliest. According to official estimates, the pending flats value about Rs 400 crore.\n",
      "Officials said the disposal of flats is on hold and cannot be put to auction during the regular auction of other unsold properties owned by the GDA. The GDA had constructed 2,563 such flats – 2,267 at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha housing schemes, and 296 at Madhuban Bapudham in 2015.\n",
      "“Each flat is a 2BHK and the average cost per flat is about Rs 30 lakh. Initially, all 2,267 flats at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha were booked but many buyers later opted for a refund. As of now, we have about 1,056 flats at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha and all 296 flats under this scheme at Madhuban Bapudhan left with us. Due to this, a lot of revenue inflow is stuck,” said an officer from authority’s property department.\n",
      "GDA sources said that the authority is stuck on two accounts – one, the same scheme with the name ‘Samajwadi’ may be difficult to launch under the present regime and two, a new scheme with a different name will involve escalation in prices.\n",
      "“Flats under the Samajwadi scheme were given to allottees after reduction of 3% each of contingency and overhead charges, which are loaded 15% each to the cost of the flats under normal schemes. The Samajwadi scheme has already closed down and the 3% exemption from the charges may not be available anymore. Further, if there is a new scheme launched for the flats, the cost will have to be revised as per current circle rates,” said Kanchan Verma, authority’s vice chairperson.\n",
      "Officials said they have requested the government to take a call on the matter. They added that the flats cannot be put to auction due to cost issues and this cannot be decided at the local level. Also, any new scheme for the flats will have to be decided by the state government.\n",

      "“Flats under the Samajwadi scheme were given to allottees after reduction of 3% each of contingency and overhead charges, which are loaded 15% each to the cost of the flats under normal schemes. The Samajwadi scheme has already closed down and the 3% exemption from the charges may not be available anymore. Further, if there is a new scheme launched for the flats, the cost will have to be revised as per current circle rates,” said Kanchan Verma, authority’s vice chairperson.\n",
      "Officials said they have requested the government to take a call on the matter. They added that the flats cannot be put to auction due to cost issues and this cannot be decided at the local level. Also, any new scheme for the flats will have to be decided by the state government.\n",
      "“We have written to state officials to decide. The flats under the scheme cannot be disposed of and we cannot put these to auction either. Any direction in this regard will have to be received from state officials,” Verma added.\n",

      "US real estate sales to Chinese buyers to hit 8-year low: Report\n",
      "US home sales to Chinese buyers are likely to drop to an eight-year low in the year ending next March as a prolonged Sino-US trade war hits demand, according to estimates from Chinese real estate website Juwai.com.\n",
      "Analogous to US portals like Realtor.com and Trulia, Juwai is China’s largest international property website, hosting some 2.8 million listings on both sides of China’s internet censorship mechanism known as the Great Firewall.\n",
      "Based on its enquiry and buyer data, as well as feedback from industry partners, the site estimated US home sales to Chinese buyers would fall to between $10 billion and $12 billion in the year to March 2020.\n",
      "While that represents just a fraction of 1% of the $1.6 trillion worth of US homes sold annually, it is down from the $13.4 billion reported for the year ended in March by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and from more than $30 billion in both 2017 and 2018.\n",
      "The site’s executive chairman, Malaysian-based German tech entrepreneur Georg Chmiel, said worries over US visas, the weakening yuan and the desire to diversify investments had spurred a collapse in sales to Chinese buyers after a five-year surge.\n",
      "“The Trump administration’s tariffs, aggressive rhetoric, targeting of Chinese graduate students at US universities, and new visa red tape have all hurt Chinese demand,” he told Reuters.\n",
      "After a decade of gains against the dollar, China’s yuan currency has fallen 11% in the past 18 months, capped by a devaluation in August which was widely seen as a political move in the trade war and which added to buyers’ concerns.\n",
      "Chmiel said for Chinese customers US properties served as both financial investments and potential homes for them or for offspring, who they hoped one day would study and work in the United States.\n",
      "“With the trade war going on, it’s easy to imagine a scenario in which you might be forced to sell or your investment might otherwise lose value,” he said.\n",
      "California fading\n",
      "The trend has shown up at US housebuilders this year, with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc flagging sluggish sales in California, which makes up as much as 30% of its business and is the main target market for Chinese buyers.\n",
      "The country’s number two builder, Lennar Corp also recently put the blame for soft sales in the state and a western region which accounts for 42% of sales, on fading Chinese demand.\n",
      "Gay Cororaton, a senior economist at the NAR, did not provide detailed forecasts, but said a slowing Chinese economy and the dollar’s strength were likely to keep pushing down Chinese buying, particularly in prime markets such as California.\n",
      "“Chinese buyers form a significant portion of international home sales in California, where home prices have been increasing steadily, and that has been one of the factors acting as a deterrent for home purchases, when the yuan has declined,” she said.\n",
      "“They might look for properties in areas that are less expensive than California, such as Texas and Seattle. And this could put downward pressure on prices in California,” Cororaton said.\n",
      "Dean Jones, principal and owner at Seattle-based brokerage Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty, said the focus was shifting to “secondary gateway markets” such as Seattle, because of their strong economies and relative affordability.\n",
      "Jones said Seattle was wooing international buyers with properties selling for a third or half the price of real estate in San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n",
      "One 41-year old businessman from Tianjin in China, who is looking for properties with a US broker and asked not to be named, told Reuters he hoped the trade war would be resolved soon and that he was considering waiting it out before buying.\n",
      "“The United States is a livable country where the natural environment, climate, education, medical care, commodity prices are all satisfying,” he said.\n",
      "“(But) if the trade war keeps intense, it may affect my income and I will probably reduce (my investment).”\n",

      "As President Donald Trump visits the United Nations building in New York this week, he won’t be focused only on the global challenges facing the world body — he’s still reliving the real estate deal there that got away.\n",
      "More than a decade later, Trump vividly recalls the overtures he made to rebuild the 39-story tower in the early 2000s and posits that he could have done a better job with the $2.3 billion project, which took about three years longer than anticipated and came in more than $400 million over budget.\n",
      "In the leadup to this week’s UN General Assembly meetings, the president reminisced with reporters on Air Force One this past week about his efforts to win the project.\n",
      "“I offered to rebuild it at a tiny fraction of what they were going to build it for,” he said.\n",
      "In 2005, then-developer Trump went before a US Senate committee to complain that the UN was bungling the project. “They don’t know what they want, they don’t know what they have, they don’t know what they’re doing,” Trump said.\n",
      "He appealed to the panel to let him manage the project. He would even waive his fee, he said. In the end, he didn’t get the project, but his words were music to senators concerned about costs.\n",
      "“When can you start?” said one appreciative lawmaker, Sen. Mark Dayton, D-Minn., who went on to serve as the state’s governor for two terms.\n",
      "Trump is scheduled to speak to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. He was asked if he’ll think back to his real estate days when he returns to the UN compound. It sounded like he certainly would.\n",
      "“I was a very good real estate developer,” he reminisced. He added that he had correctly predicted “It will end up being much more” than expected.\n",
      "“They didn’t even know what New York steam was versus a boiler,” he said of the developers. “They knew nothing.”\n",
      "Trump said an ambassador, he believed from Sweden, contacted him to ask how he could have built Trump World Tower, right across the street from the UN compound, for far less than what was envisioned for the smaller U.N. headquarters.\n",
      "“I said, ‘Because I know how the game is played,’“ Trump recalled.\n",
      "Trump said he could have completed the project for about $500 million. He would have used marble instead of terrazzo, which is much more expensive, he recalled.\n",
      "The UN compound was largely built between 1949 and 1952. Over time, it no longer conformed to safety and fire codes, or to security needs. The US provided about $488 million to help pay for the renovations, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report.\n",
      "Trump clearly got a kick out of rehashing the episode. It gave him one more chance to relive his developer days.\n",

      "Housing societies still find it difficult to get land ownership \n",
      "It’s been nearly two years since the Maharashtra government relaxed the rules on deemed conveyance, allowing cooperative housing societies to apply for DC, even in the absence of an Occupancy Certificate. \n",
      "The government introduced Deemed Conveyance (DC) in 2008 and published the rules in 2010. Under this provision, a society without conveyance could apply to the Deputy District Registrar (DDR) of Co-operative Societies, who after verifying the documents submitted and hearing both the society and the developer will, if justified, pass an order conveying the land in favour of the CHS. In 2017, the government relaxed the rule on the need to submit an Occupancy Certificate. However this relaxation has had little impact on the number of applications, which continues to be low.\n",
      "“This is because all other conditions remain the same, and this includes approaching four different departments to complete the process. Hence it still takes one to two years for a CHS to secure deemed conveyance. Failing to understand the complexities involved, CHS office-bearers often stop the process midway,” says Ramesh Prabhu, chairman of the Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association (MSWA).\n",
      "WHY IT MATTERS\n",
      "A Conveyance Deed transfers land ownership from the developer or previous land holder to the cooperative housing society, giving the latter the right to use any notional floor space left over after construction, or any additional floor space, directly or via Transfer of Development Rights. It also allows the CHS to raise loans for repairs by mortgaging the property and to have a say in redeveloping the building. In the absence of a conveyance deed, these rights rest with the developer or landowner.\n",
      "To prevent potential misuse of such rights, the government introduced Deemed Conveyance. But according to Prabhu, against pending conveyance of around 60,000 societies across Maharashtra, only about 6,000 have applied for DC.\n",
      "Pankaj Jebale, DDR for cooperative societies, Mumbai (3), attributes the lukewarm response to a lack of awareness. “Primarily, societies are unaware of the importance of conveyance. Second, they do not have the required documents. Nor do they understand the process to be followed. There is a misconception that it is a lengthy and expensive process, which it is not,” he adds.\n",
      "TRUTH OR DARE\n",
      "While the process followed by DDRs may be as simple and inexpensive as Jebale says, it is the pre- and post- paperwork that takes up time and effort. The CHS has to collect 20-odd documents just to apply. \n",
      "“After a favourable order from the DDR, the conveyance deed is executed. The society then has to approach the Collector of Stamps and pay the stamp duty, then meet the sub-registrar and get the conveyance deed registered,” says advocate Vinod Sampat, president of the Co-operative Societies Residents Users and Welfare Association. “Thereafter one has to apply to the city survey office to get the property card transferred in the society’s name. Even at this stage, issues can crop up. If there are differences in the area mentioned in the approved plan and in the document lodged for registration, the CHS will have to execute a deed of rectification. And if the builder challenges the DC order in courts, it will prolong the case further. All this costs money,” Sampat says\n",
      "OUTSOURCING\n",
      "Consultants and advocates dealing with housing society issues can help ease the process for the CHS, but that will add to the cost. “So far, we have spent around Rs 40,000 per member, including consultant’s fee, despite all members having paid stamp duty. We have no idea how much more we will have to spend till we enter our society’s name in the Property Card,” says PK Mutha, treasurer at New Garden View CHS in Andheri, which secured a DC order six months ago.\n",
      "For Pearl Heaven CHS Vikhroli, the costs increased after the builder appealed against the DC order. “We applied for DC in May 2011, secured the DC order in December. However, the builder appealed against the order in court,” says Francina D’Souza, chairperson of the society. “Though the court finally ruled in our favour, and the society’s name was entered in the Property Card in 2013, we had by then spent over Rs 12 lakh on the entire process, spread across 55 flats.” \n",
      "The best way forward, say realty consultants, is to simplify the process, reduce the number of documents to be submitted, and aim for a single-window clearance system.\n",
      "Since, by law, the developer is required to convey the land to the CHS within four months of the housing society being formed, some argue that the DC should be granted automatically after verifying the society’s registration details, instead of making the society run around for it. A builder with any grievances in the matter could then apply for the process to be reviewed within a specific period.\n",

      "A Conveyance Deed transfers land ownership from the developer or previous land holder to the cooperative housing society, giving the latter the right to use any notional floor space left over after construction, or any additional floor space, directly or via Transfer of Development Rights. It also allows the CHS to raise loans for repairs by mortgaging the property and to have a say in redeveloping the building. In the absence of a conveyance deed, these rights rest with the developer or landowner.\n",
      "To prevent potential misuse of such rights, the government introduced Deemed Conveyance. But according to Prabhu, against pending conveyance of around 60,000 societies across Maharashtra, only about 6,000 have applied for DC.\n",
      "Pankaj Jebale, DDR for cooperative societies, Mumbai (3), attributes the lukewarm response to a lack of awareness. “Primarily, societies are unaware of the importance of conveyance. Second, they do not have the required documents. Nor do they understand the process to be followed. There is a misconception that it is a lengthy and expensive process, which it is not,” he adds.\n",
      "TRUTH OR DARE\n",
      "While the process followed by DDRs may be as simple and inexpensive as Jebale says, it is the pre- and post- paperwork that takes up time and effort. The CHS has to collect 20-odd documents just to apply. \n",
      "“After a favourable order from the DDR, the conveyance deed is executed. The society then has to approach the Collector of Stamps and pay the stamp duty, then meet the sub-registrar and get the conveyance deed registered,” says advocate Vinod Sampat, president of the Co-operative Societies Residents Users and Welfare Association. “Thereafter one has to apply to the city survey office to get the property card transferred in the society’s name. Even at this stage, issues can crop up. If there are differences in the area mentioned in the approved plan and in the document lodged for registration, the CHS will have to execute a deed of rectification. And if the builder challenges the DC order in courts, it will prolong the case further. All this costs money,” Sampat says\n",
      "OUTSOURCING\n",
      "Consultants and advocates dealing with housing society issues can help ease the process for the CHS, but that will add to the cost. “So far, we have spent around Rs 40,000 per member, including consultant’s fee, despite all members having paid stamp duty. We have no idea how much more we will have to spend till we enter our society’s name in the Property Card,” says PK Mutha, treasurer at New Garden View CHS in Andheri, which secured a DC order six months ago.\n",
      "For Pearl Heaven CHS Vikhroli, the costs increased after the builder appealed against the DC order. “We applied for DC in May 2011, secured the DC order in December. However, the builder appealed against the order in court,” says Francina D’Souza, chairperson of the society. “Though the court finally ruled in our favour, and the society’s name was entered in the Property Card in 2013, we had by then spent over Rs 12 lakh on the entire process, spread across 55 flats.” \n",
      "The best way forward, say realty consultants, is to simplify the process, reduce the number of documents to be submitted, and aim for a single-window clearance system.\n",
      "Since, by law, the developer is required to convey the land to the CHS within four months of the housing society being formed, some argue that the DC should be granted automatically after verifying the society’s registration details, instead of making the society run around for it. A builder with any grievances in the matter could then apply for the process to be reviewed within a specific period.\n",

       "  'Article': 'Realtors on Friday hailed the government’s decision to cut corporate tax, saying the move will have a ripple effect on all sectors including real estate, improve liquidity of cash-starved developers and boost property demand especially in the commercial segment. Realtors’ apex body CREDAI Chairman Jaxay Shah said: “It’s a full house blockbuster Friday for India Inc. Game changer announcements. Market sentiment will change completely in all sectors including real estate”. “It is a due corrective step by the Centre to uplift investor’s sentiment and prompt investment back in drying up Indian economy. The move is well intended to revive growth traction of the economy,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, President, NAREDCO. CREDAI President Satish Magar added: “The series of announcements by FM are most reassuring as they tell of the Government being sensitive to the economic needs of the people. We are most hopeful that the special needs of housing would soon get addressed to further accelerate the investment cycle.”   Property consultant Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said: “This big-bang move will have a rippling impact on all sectors including real estate as it will encourage foreign institutional investors to invest in the country.”   “As and when the overall financial health of the economy improves with these slew of measures, there will be heightened activity within real estate – by both actual home buyers and investors alike,” he added. JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: “The tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government’s ambitious Make in India programme.”   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added. Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: “Slowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today’s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.”   On the flip side, this decision would see the government’s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. “However, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,” Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a “milestone effort” to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. “This substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,” he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. “As a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,” Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector. Ekta World Chairman Ashok Mohanani said the decision has brought in a ray of light for the economy and hoped that sentiments would change in the real estate sector as well. Prashant Solomon, MD, Chintels India said: “For the Real estate sector this is an added benefit as it will encourage new entrants across the 200 ancillary industries that are essential to the sector’s growth.”   The revenue foregone by the government on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures will now help companies focus on investing in areas which can fillip growth in their respective sectors, said Honeyy Katiyal, Founder of Investors Clinic. Infrastructure consultant REPL CMD Pradeep Misra said the infrastructure industry, which was until now reeling under huge tax burden, will now eye foreign investments but also look forward to the domestic investors. Taranpreet Singh, Tass Advisors Partner, said: “A pre-Diwali bonanza announced by the Finance Minister with primarily 2 objectives -- firstly to promote industrial production and achieve the Make in India motive of the Modi-led government, secondly, to foster positive signs to the glooming stock market.”   Property brokerage firm Wealth Clinic director Amit Raheja said the corporate tax rate cut was much needed relief for the developers which are facing liquidity crunch.

       "  'Article': 'Realtors on Friday hailed the government’s decision to cut corporate tax, saying the move will have a ripple effect on all sectors including real estate, improve liquidity of cash-starved developers and boost property demand especially in the commercial segment. Realtors’ apex body CREDAI Chairman Jaxay Shah said: “It’s a full house blockbuster Friday for India Inc. Game changer announcements. Market sentiment will change completely in all sectors including real estate”. “It is a due corrective step by the Centre to uplift investor’s sentiment and prompt investment back in drying up Indian economy. The move is well intended to revive growth traction of the economy,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, President, NAREDCO. CREDAI President Satish Magar added: “The series of announcements by FM are most reassuring as they tell of the Government being sensitive to the economic needs of the people. We are most hopeful that the special needs of housing would soon get addressed to further accelerate the investment cycle.”   Property consultant Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said: “This big-bang move will have a rippling impact on all sectors including real estate as it will encourage foreign institutional investors to invest in the country.”   “As and when the overall financial health of the economy improves with these slew of measures, there will be heightened activity within real estate – by both actual home buyers and investors alike,” he added. JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: “The tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government’s ambitious Make in India programme.”   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added. Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: “Slowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today’s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.”   On the flip side, this decision would see the government’s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. “However, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,” Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a “milestone effort” to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. “This substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,” he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. “As a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,” Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector.

Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a “milestone effort” to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. “This substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,” he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. “As a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,” Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector. Ekta World Chairman Ashok Mohanani said the decision has brought in a ray of light for the economy and hoped that sentiments would change in the real estate sector as well. Prashant Solomon, MD, Chintels India said: “For the Real estate sector this is an added benefit as it will encourage new entrants across the 200 ancillary industries that are essential to the sector’s growth.”   The revenue foregone by the government on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures will now help companies focus on investing in areas which can fillip growth in their respective sectors, said Honeyy Katiyal, Founder of Investors Clinic. Infrastructure consultant REPL CMD Pradeep Misra said the infrastructure industry, which was until now reeling under huge tax burden, will now eye foreign investments but also look forward to the domestic investors. Taranpreet Singh, Tass Advisors Partner, said: “A pre-Diwali bonanza announced by the Finance Minister with primarily 2 objectives -- firstly to promote industrial production and achieve the Make in India motive of the Modi-led government, secondly, to foster positive signs to the glooming stock market.”   Property brokerage firm Wealth Clinic director Amit Raheja said the corporate tax rate cut was much needed relief for the developers which are facing liquidity crunch. In the biggest reduction in 28 years, the government on Friday slashed corporate tax by almost 10 percentage points as it looked to pull the economy out of a six-year low growth and a 45-year high unemployment rate by reviving private investments with a Rs 1.45-lakh crore tax break.(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text)First Published:\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSep 21, 2019 14:49 IST'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Realtors on Friday hailed the government’s decision to cut corporate tax, saying the move will have a ripple effect on all sectors including real estate, improve liquidity of cash-starved developers and boost property demand especially in the commercial segment. Realtors’ apex body CREDAI Chairman Jaxay Shah said: “It’s a full house blockbuster Friday for India Inc. Game changer announcements. Market sentiment will change completely in all sectors including real estate”. “It is a due corrective step by the Centre to uplift investor’s sentiment and prompt investment back in drying up Indian economy. The move is well intended to revive growth traction of the economy,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, President, NAREDCO. CREDAI President Satish Magar added: “The series of announcements by FM are most reassuring as they tell of the Government being sensitive to the economic needs of the people. We are most hopeful that the special needs of housing would soon get addressed to further accelerate the investment cycle.”   Property consultant Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said: “This big-bang move will have a rippling impact on all sectors including real estate as it will encourage foreign institutional investors to invest in the country.”   “As and when the overall financial health of the economy improves with these slew of measures, there will be heightened activity within real estate – by both actual home buyers and investors alike,” he added. JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: “The tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government’s ambitious Make in India programme.”   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added.

JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: “The tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government’s ambitious Make in India programme.”   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added. Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: “Slowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today’s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.”   On the flip side, this decision would see the government’s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. “However, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,” Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a “milestone effort” to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. “This substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,” he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. “As a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,” Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector. Ekta World Chairman Ashok Mohanani said the decision has brought in a ray of light for the economy and hoped that sentiments would change in the real estate sector as well. Prashant Solomon, MD, Chintels India said: “For the Real estate sector this is an added benefit as it will encourage new entrants across the 200 ancillary industries that are essential to the sector’s growth.”   The revenue foregone by the government on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures will now help companies focus on investing in areas which can fillip growth in their respective sectors, said Honeyy Katiyal, Founder of Investors Clinic. Infrastructure consultant REPL CMD Pradeep Misra said the infrastructure industry, which was until now reeling under huge tax burden, will now eye foreign investments but also look forward to the domestic investors. Taranpreet Singh, Tass Advisors Partner, said: “A pre-Diwali bonanza announced by the Finance Minister with primarily 2 objectives -- firstly to promote industrial production and achieve the Make in India motive of the Modi-led government, secondly, to foster positive signs to the glooming stock market.”   Property brokerage firm Wealth Clinic director Amit Raheja said the corporate tax rate cut was much needed relief for the developers which are facing liquidity crunch. In the biggest reduction in 28 years, the government on Friday slashed corporate tax by almost 10 percentage points as it looked to pull the economy out of a six-year low growth and a 45-year high unemployment rate by reviving private investments with a Rs 1.45-lakh crore tax break.(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text)First Published:\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSep 21, 2019 14:49 IST'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Realtors on Friday hailed the government’s decision to cut corporate tax, saying the move will have a ripple effect on all sectors including real estate, improve liquidity of cash-starved developers and boost property demand especially in the commercial segment. Realtors’ apex body CREDAI Chairman Jaxay Shah said: “It’s a full house blockbuster Friday for India Inc. Game changer announcements. Market sentiment will change completely in all sectors including real estate”. “It is a due corrective step by the Centre to uplift investor’s sentiment and prompt investment back in drying up Indian economy. The move is well intended to revive growth traction of the economy,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, President, NAREDCO. CREDAI President Satish Magar added: “The series of announcements by FM are most reassuring as they tell of the Government being sensitive to the economic needs of the people. We are most hopeful that the special needs of housing would soon get addressed to further accelerate the investment cycle.”   Property consultant Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said: “This big-bang move will have a rippling impact on all sectors including real estate as it will encourage foreign institutional investors to invest in the country.”   “As and when the overall financial health of the economy improves with these slew of measures, there will be heightened activity within real estate – by both actual home buyers and investors alike,” he added. JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: “The tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government’s ambitious Make in India programme.”   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added. Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: “Slowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today’s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.”   On the flip side, this decision would see the government’s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. “However, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,” Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a “milestone effort” to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. “This substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,” he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. “As a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,” Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector. Ekta World Chairman Ashok Mohanani said the decision has brought in a ray of light for the economy and hoped that sentiments would change in the real estate sector as well. Prashant Solomon, MD, Chintels India said: “For the Real estate sector this is an added benefit as it will encourage new entrants across the 200 ancillary industries that are essential to the sector’s growth.”   The revenue foregone by the government on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures will now help companies focus on investing in areas which can fillip growth in their respective sectors, said Honeyy Katiyal, Founder of Investors Clinic. Infrastructure consultant REPL CMD Pradeep Misra said the infrastructure industry, which was until now reeling under huge tax burden, will now eye foreign investments but also look forward to the domestic investors. Taranpreet Singh, Tass Advisors Partner, said: “A pre-Diwali bonanza announced by the Finance Minister with primarily 2 objectives -- firstly to promote industrial production and achieve the Make in India motive of the Modi-led government, secondly, to foster positive signs to the glooming stock market.”   Property brokerage firm Wealth Clinic director Amit Raheja said the corporate tax rate cut was much needed relief for the developers which are facing liquidity crunch.

Infrastructure consultant REPL CMD Pradeep Misra said the infrastructure industry, which was until now reeling under huge tax burden, will now eye foreign investments but also look forward to the domestic investors. Taranpreet Singh, Tass Advisors Partner, said: “A pre-Diwali bonanza announced by the Finance Minister with primarily 2 objectives -- firstly to promote industrial production and achieve the Make in India motive of the Modi-led government, secondly, to foster positive signs to the glooming stock market.”   Property brokerage firm Wealth Clinic director Amit Raheja said the corporate tax rate cut was much needed relief for the developers which are facing liquidity crunch. In the biggest reduction in 28 years, the government on Friday slashed corporate tax by almost 10 percentage points as it looked to pull the economy out of a six-year low growth and a 45-year high unemployment rate by reviving private investments with a Rs 1.45-lakh crore tax break.(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text)First Published:\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSep 21, 2019 14:49 IST'},\n",
       " 37: {'Title': '‘Blockbuster Friday’ announcements for India Inc will have ripple effect on real estate too: CREDAI',\n",
       "  'Article': 'Realtors on Friday hailed the government’s decision to cut corporate tax, saying the move will have a ripple effect on all sectors including real estate, improve liquidity of cash-starved developers and boost property demand especially in the commercial segment. Realtors’ apex body CREDAI Chairman Jaxay Shah said: “It’s a full house blockbuster Friday for India Inc. Game changer announcements. Market sentiment will change completely in all sectors including real estate”. “It is a due corrective step by the Centre to uplift investor’s sentiment and prompt investment back in drying up Indian economy. The move is well intended to revive growth traction of the economy,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, President, NAREDCO. CREDAI President Satish Magar added: “The series of announcements by FM are most reassuring as they tell of the Government being sensitive to the economic needs of the people. We are most hopeful that the special needs of housing would soon get addressed to further accelerate the investment cycle.”   Property consultant Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said: “This big-bang move will have a rippling impact on all sectors including real estate as it will encourage foreign institutional investors to invest in the country.”   “As and when the overall financial health of the economy improves with these slew of measures, there will be heightened activity within real estate – by both actual home buyers and investors alike,” he added. JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said the move is expected to bolster growth of industrial real estate development in the country. He said the reduction in MAT will help real estate developers engaged in SEZs and affordable housing. Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE, said: “The tax announcement is indeed a welcome measure and will definitely boost the Government’s ambitious Make in India programme.”   The move would not only benefit manufacturing sector but would also have cascading impact on other sectors including real estate, he added. Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of PropTiger and Housing.com, said: “Slowing consumption and falling private investment were both pulling down GDP growth. Today’s announcement to reduce corporate tax rates by almost 10 per cent should help in kickstarting a fresh private investment cycle.”   On the flip side, this decision would see the government’s fiscal deficit come under pressure and hence result in lower government spending, he added. “However, overall this decision will have a positive impact on the economy because it will provide much needed relief to corporates struggling with slowing consumer demand and will encourage them to once again start thinking about new investments,” Agarwala said. Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed it a “milestone effort” to kickstart the Indian economy and boost production. “This substantial direct tax reduction will allow more liquidity for the corporates that are currently assuming drastic measures to protect their profitability,” he added. These measures will complement the monetary policy measures taken by the RBI in increasing liquidity and consumer spending, he said. “As a trickle-down effect of this, we should be hoping for a revival for the real estate sector as well. This boost will certainly accelerate demand for commercial spaces, but we understand that the financial stability expected will propel growth for the beleaguered residential market in the near future,” Baijal said. Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said this was a long-standing demand of the Indian corporates, including the real estate sector.
